# NFC Core
A Space Engineers conversion mod.

## technology
this mod includes three additional technology tiers to the game, based on [Sandragos' Tiered Tech Blocks](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1682499145) mod.  all production blocks, thrusters, power generation, storage, detectors, and many others now have these additional tiers.  each tier doubles productivity (or range or capacity), with the highest tier's ability surpassing even prototech.

|tier name|productivity|
|---------------|----|
| ***vanilla*** | 1x |
| advanced      | 2x |
| complex       | 4x |
| ***prototech*** | 6x |
| exotic        | 8x |

building higher tiered blocks requires a number of corresponding tech components.  these may be built from:

|technology|build cost||fe|si|co|ag|au|u|pt|
|----------|----------|-|-----------|-----------|---------|---------|--------|--------|-------|
| advanced tech | (just ingots)                     |=|     2,000 |     1,200 |     300 |     200 |    100 |      -- |    -- | 
| complex tech  | 30x advanced tech + 500 uranium   |=|    60,000 |    36,000 |   9,000 |   6,000 |  3,000 | **500** |    -- | 
| exotic tech   | 30x complex tech + 3,000 platinum |=| 1,800,000 | 1,080,000 | 270,000 | 180,000 | 90,000 |  15,000 | **3,000** | 

## block durability
steel and interior plates gain double durability, imparting additional health to anything built from them.  light and heavy armor blocks, steel beams, blast doors, and fps walls all gain 25% damage resistance to damage and reduced deformation.

## warp drive, not jump drive
jump drives have been removed.  if you do manage to place one, it will not charge.  in their place, this mod uses the warp-style [elite dangerous fsd supercrise drive](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2640137506) mod, including player-buildable and prototech drives in both large and small sizes.  these drives consume massive amounts of power, but offer speeds up to 50 km/sec.
